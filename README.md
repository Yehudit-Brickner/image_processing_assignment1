# image_processing_assignment1


this project was done in pycharm
<br> python version 3.10.0

there are 3 files of code:
- ex1_utils.py
- gamma.py
- ex1_main.py

in this assignment we had to write 6 functions
- imReadAndConvert = read an image and return the numpy array of the image
- imDisplay = display the image
- transformRGB2YIQ = transform the image from RGB color space to YIQ color space and return the new array
- transformYIQ2RGB = transform the image from YIQ color space to RGB color space and return the new array
- hsitogramEqualize = take an image and spread out the histogram so that there is more contrast in the image and return the new image the original histogran array and the changed histogram array
- quantizeImage = takes the image and chnages it so that it only has x colors, returning a list of the images array, and a list of the mse.
- gammaDisplay = dispaly an image and a trackbar that will show the gamma transfmation
